# Hi nerds 👋

I’m Felix, an 🏓  interaction designer and 👨‍💻 frontend developer. I’m dedicated to Open Source and Accessibility.

**Currently:** Studying Interaction Design B.A. @ HfG Schwäbisch Gmünd combining my web tech background with design thinking.

Open source is at the heart of my work with a special focus on accessibility and performance. Well known for my expertise and leadership in frontend development, I worked with various clients in the past creating all kinds and sizes of web applications.

These days, I mainly create things in the JS ecosystem, but also have a deep understanding of the PHP stack with focus on Drupal.

Code is a medium through which I realize my designs. The design part always comes first and defines the code, not the other way around. Creating meaningful interaction comes with understanding the user.

That's why, in addition to my technical background, I like to create interaction and design. Especially, with a talented team in an inclusive environment.

I love going outside to enjoy nature and do sports like swimming and biking. Keeping fit and healthy is really important to me and it gets me the energy to do the creative work.
