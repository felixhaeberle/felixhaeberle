# Hi nerds 👋

I’m Felix, an 🏓  interaction designer and 👨‍💻 frontend developer. I’m dedicated to Open Source and Accessibility.

**Currently:** Studying Interaction Design B.A. @[HfG](https://www.hfg-gmuend.de/) Schwäbisch Gmünd combining my web tech background with design thinking.
[//]: # "**Working on:** Various tools for the insurance sector @[Kaiser X Labs](https://www.kaiser-x.com/), designing the next insurtech solutions and scaling design systems."

**Open source** is at the heart of my work with a special focus on accessibility and performance. Well known for my expertise and leadership in frontend development, I worked with various clients in the past **creating all kinds and sizes of web applications**. These days, I mainly create things in the **JS ecosystem**, but also have a deep understanding of the PHP stack with focus on **Drupal**.

I love going outside to enjoy nature and do sports like swimming 🏊‍♂️ and biking 🚴‍♂️. Keeping me fit and healthy is really important to me and it gets me the energy to do the creative work.
