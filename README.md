# Hi nerds 👋

I’m Felix, an 🏓  interaction designer and 👨‍💻 frontend developer. I’m dedicated to Open Source and i18n.

**Currently:** Design Engineer @[inlang](https://github.com/inlang) – building the next generation of open source globalization infrastructure.

Before that: Studying Interaction Design B.A. @[HfG](https://www.hfg-gmuend.de/) Schwäbisch Gmünd combining my web tech background with design thinking.

**Bachelor Thesis:** [Stage](https://getstage.app) 🪩

**Open source** is at the heart of my work with a special focus on accessibility and performance. Well known for my expertise and leadership in frontend development, I worked with various clients in the past **creating all kinds and sizes of web applications**. These days, I mainly create things in the **JS ecosystem**, but also have a deep understanding of the PHP stack with focus on **Drupal**.

I love going outside to enjoy nature and do sports like swimming 🏊‍♂️ and biking 🚴‍♂️. Keeping me fit and healthy is really important to me and it gets me the energy to do the creative work.
